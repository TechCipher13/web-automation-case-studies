# Web Automation Case Studies

Welcome to the **Web Automation Case Studies** project! This repository contains sample automation test cases created using Playwright, a powerful end-to-end testing framework.

## Automated Test Scenarios

This project demonstrates an automated test scenario covering the following steps:

1. **Log In**: Authenticate using a username and password.
2. **Select Product**: Browse and select a product from the catalog.
3. **Add to Cart**: Add the selected product to the shopping cart.
4. **Place Order**: Fill out the form details and submit the order.
5. **Validate Success**: Verify that the order was placed successfully and the confirmation message is displayed.

## Project Components

This repository includes several key components to facilitate automation testing with Playwright:

- **Automated Test Scripts**: Comprehensive test scripts that automate the user journey described above.
- **Reusable Selectors and Functions**: Common selectors and UI action functions to promote code reusability and maintainability.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and utilities for Playwright actions.
- **Configuration**: Playwright configuration files to manage timeouts, base URLs, and execution devices.

## Execution Report

Upon executing the tests, you will receive a detailed report summarizing the test results. Below is an example of a report generated from the test execution:
